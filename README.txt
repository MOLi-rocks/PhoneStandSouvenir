# Summary

This is my second "Thing".

There are dozens of designs for phone stands on Thingiverse, and I've tried a few of them, but my INNOS D6000 phone has two batteries which makes it quite heavy and thicker than most mobile phones. So I thought I'd have a crack at designing my own mobile phone stand, and this is the result.

It can be a bit of a balancing act with just one stand, so you may need to print two.

There are four different base styles to choose from.

Hope you like it.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: RepRap
Printer: Original Prusa i3 MK2
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2mm
Infill: 15%

Notes: 
The base was scaled in Slic3r to 105% in the Z axis just to make the bottom of the slot a little bit thicker (from 1.0 to 1.3mm). You may not feel the need to do that.
I printed it with a 10mm brim to make it stick to the print bed without warping. I tried it with just 6mm brim but that wasn't enough to stop the ABS lifting at the corners.

# Post-Printing

Just remove the brim and rub down the edges that were in contact with the print bed. Takes about 5 minutes. Push fit the stand into the base. It'll be a good tight fit. You can glue it if you want to, but I don't think it's necessary.

# How I Designed This

I designed the first version as one piece, but the bond between the layers on the stand upright was not very strong, and the print quality was pretty poor as the ABS was not solidifying fast enough on the previous layers creating a wobble on the layers under the one being extruded. The best solution was to separate the base from the stand.
